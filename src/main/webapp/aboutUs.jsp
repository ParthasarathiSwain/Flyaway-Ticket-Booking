               An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and freight. Airlines use aircraft to supply 
               these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and 
               operate the same flight. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a 
               governmental aviation body. Airlines may be scheduled or charter operators
